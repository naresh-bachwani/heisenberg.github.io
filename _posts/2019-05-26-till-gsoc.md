This year my project Effect Plot and PCA Visualizer got selected for GSoCâ€™19 under NumFOCUS::YellowBrick. I will be spending my summers interacting with the awesome community of YellowBrick, making new friends and coding up open-source projects and helping community as a whole. This blog will take you through my journey to become a student developer with Google Summer of Code!
