title: About me
---

I am Naresh Bachwani, a junior undergrad from National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh, India. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 

I like to play with data and dig deep into it to draw inferences and come up with unique solutions. I like the idea of open source projects. Currently, I am working on a project with YellowBrick under NumFOCUS umbrella, for Google Summer of Code.

I grew up in Jaipur, India and moved to Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh for my engineering studies. Since then I have been exploring mountains and data!! 

Feel free to get in touch through Email or LinkedIn.
